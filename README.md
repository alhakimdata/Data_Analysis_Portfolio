# Refugee and Asylum Data Analysis (2019–2024)

## Introduction

The global displacement crisis continues to present challenges for humanitarian organizations, policymakers, and host countries. This analysis explores trends in the refugee and asylum dataset from 2019 to 2024, with a focus on the **population of concern**, the **share of refugees**, the **stateless population**, and **year-on-year growth dynamics**.

By answering five key questions, this report highlights the main contributors to displacement and provides insights that NGOs can leverage for program design, advocacy, and resource allocation.

## Key Findings & Insights

 
1. How has the total population of concern changed over time (2019–2024)?

![Chart 1](Data_Analysis_Portfolio/Refugee_Asylum_NGO_Portfolio_Project/Images/Q1-Portfolio-image-1.png)

* The population of concern increased from **4.27 million in 2019** to **6.59 million in 2024**, reflecting a **total growth of 55%** over the period.

* The trend was steadily upward, though growth rates slowed after 2022.

* **Peak growth occurred in 2022 (18.47%)**, suggesting a surge in displacement events or reporting.

* By 2024, growth stabilized at **0.81%**, indicating a plateau.

**Implication**: NGOs must be prepared for surges in displacement that can quickly overwhelm existing systems, while also planning for sustained support as populations remain high.

2. What percentage of the total population of concern are refugees each year?

![Chart 2](Data_Analysis_Portfolio/Refugee_Asylum_NGO_Portfolio_Project/Images/Q2-Portfolio-image-2-2.png)

* Refugees made up a relatively **small but consistent proportion** of the population of concern, averaging around **4–5% annually**.

* The lowest share was in **2021 (4.11%)**, while the highest was in **2024 (4.84%)**.

**Implication**: While refugees are a visible part of the crisis, the majority of the population of concern consists of other vulnerable groups (e.g., stateless persons, asylum seekers). Programs must address the **broader spectrum of displacement**, not just refugees.

3. Which year had the highest number of stateless persons?

![Chart 3](Data_Analysis_Portfolio/Refugee_Asylum_NGO_Portfolio_Project/Images/Q3-Portfolio-image-3.png)

* The number of stateless persons remained **consistently high**, ranging between **4.17 million and 4.43 million**.

* The **peak year was 2022 (4.43 million)**, aligning with the year of highest overall population growth.

**Implication**: Statelessness remains a chronic issue, requiring **long-term legal and advocacy solutions**. Unlike sudden refugee flows, statelessness is persistent and demands **systemic reforms** at national and international levels.

4. What is the year-on-year growth rate of the total population of concern?

![Table 4](Data_Analysis_Portfolio/Refugee_Asylum_NGO_Portfolio_Project/Images/Q4-Portfolio-image-4-1.png)

![Chart 4](Data_Analysis_Portfolio/Refugee_Asylum_NGO_Portfolio_Project/Images/Q4-Portfolio-image-4.png)

Growth fluctuated significantly:

* **2019–2020**: +8.46%

* **2020–2021**: +12.08%

* **2021–2022**: +18.47% (highest growth)

* **2022–2023**: +6.48%

* **2023–2024**: +0.81% (near stagnation)

This suggests a spike in 2022 followed by a leveling off.

**Implication**: Sudden spikes strain humanitarian resources. The slowdown after 2022 could reflect improved management, stabilization, or reporting adjustments, but humanitarian actors must remain agile for future spikes.

5. Which category of displaced people contributes the most to the total each year?

![Table 5](Data_Analysis_Portfolio/Refugee_Asylum_NGO_Portfolio_Project/Images/Q5-Portfolio-image-5.png)

![Table 5-1](Data_Analysis_Portfolio/Refugee_Asylum_NGO_Portfolio_Project/Images/Q5-Portfolio-image-5-1-2.png)

![Chart 5](Data_Analysis_Portfolio/Refugee_Asylum_NGO_Portfolio_Project/Images/Q5-Portfolio-image-5-1.png)

* The distribution shows **stateless persons consistently contributing the largest share** of the total, averaging **13–19% annually**.

* Their share grew from **13.49% in 2019** to **19.17% in 2024**, underscoring their increasing significance in the displacement picture.

**Implication**: Stateless persons are the **largest and growing group of concern**, highlighting the need for **legal recognition**, **nationality rights**, **and inclusive policy frameworks**.

## Conclusion

Between 2019 and 2024, the **population of concern rose sharply**, peaking in 2022 before stabilizing. Refugees remained a small but steady proportion of this group, while **stateless persons emerged as the largest and most consistent category of displacement**.

For NGOs, these findings emphasize two critical priorities:

1. **Preparedness for sudden displacement surges** (like in 2022).

2. **Long-term systemic strategies** to address the persistent issue of statelessness.

This analysis demonstrates the value of data in guiding **resource allocation, program design, and advocacy efforts**. It highlights how humanitarian organizations can balance **short-term emergency responses** with **long-term structural interventions** to better support displaced populations.
